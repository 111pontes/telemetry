title: Building a CiscoLive Demo with Telemetry and Kafka

## CiscoLive Demos: Behind the Scenes

Every year at Cisco Live, my team helps put together the demos that go into the World of Solutions. Geeks that we are, we get a thrill out of showing off the art of the possible. But the real purpose of a demo is to start a conversation with the network engineers and operators who stop by our booth.     

This year, my colleague asked me to help integrate telemetry into a demo of "Continuous Automation." The goal of the demo is to illustrate how model-driven telemetry can be used with model-driven APIs to automate the provisioning process and the validation of that provisioning.  The concept is based a real customer use case that we're currently working on.  

The provisioning piece of the demo was already in place: a small Python app that utilized the YDK Python APIs to configure BGP neighbors and execute a ping from the router.
